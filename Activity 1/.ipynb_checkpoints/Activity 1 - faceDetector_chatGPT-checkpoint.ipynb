    "### Background Context\n",
    "##### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\n",
    "A popular supervised machine learning algorithm used in regression and classification. The model prediction is based on the similarities between the unseen data from the test set and its k nearest neighbors in the training set.<br>\n",
    "- **Advantage:** simple and easy to implement <br>\n",
    "- **Disadvantage:** lazy learner (train while making prediction) so slower and more costly (memory)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\n",
    "A type of deep learning neural network architecture used for image and speech processing. By using multiple interconnected layers, they can extract useful features from the input data and use them to make predictions<br>\n",
    "- **Advantage:** multiple layers enable capture and recognize variations of data<br>\n",
    "- **Disadvantage:** high complexity (expensive to train and use)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### About the Dataset\n",
    "The file contains two set of data: training and testing in the `train` and `val` folders respectively. Each of them contains two set of randomly chosen images displaying two different type of facial expressions: happy and sad. \n",

    "Accuracy tells us the ratio (unnormalized) of correctly predicted labels within the fed dataset. More specifically, after asking the model to predict on 'X_test,' it produces its dataframe of predictions into y_pred. The ratio of differences between y_pred and y_test dataframe (which is the frame that contains the properly labeled 'answers' or 'outputs') is then calculated by counting the differences between the two. In short, accuracy tells us the percentage of correct labels it got on the predicted test set.\n",

For example, precision can tell us the ratio between the correct amount of happy faces it detected versus the total amount of happy faces it detected. \n",
